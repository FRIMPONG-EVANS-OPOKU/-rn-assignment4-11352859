1. StyleSheet:
   Usage: Used to create styles in a React Native application. Similar to CSS in web development but with a syntax compliant with the native mobile environment.

2. Text:
   Usage: A component for displaying text. It can be customized with styles for font size, color, alignment, etc.

3. View:
   Usage: The most fundamental component for building UI. Comparable to a `div` tag in HTML, it's used to wrap and style other components.

4. TextInput:
   Usage: Allows users to input text into the app. Can be configured for different types of input (e.g., numbers, passwords) and styled accordingly.

5. TouchableOpacity:
   Usage: A wrapper for making views respond properly to touches. On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, creating a visual feedback effect.

6. Image:
   Usage: Used for displaying images. Supports both local and network sources. Can be styled with properties like `resizeMode`.
